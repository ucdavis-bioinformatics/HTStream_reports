# HTStream_reports
R reports based on JSON HTStream ouptut
In this project I will be joining Dr. Settles and working with a json file. Using this file in R, I will use code to extract data, and do other statistical analysis with it. Using this file I will also be able to set up graphs and tables to compare certain types of data.
